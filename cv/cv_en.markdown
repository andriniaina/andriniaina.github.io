Work experience
=========


Société Générale CIB / CTY, Commodities trading desk \hfill\mdseries <span class='date'>05/2016 - today</span>
--------------

**Lead Software Development Engineer in .NET**

I was called back to SGCIB/CTY to kickoff the FRTB project (new set of rules for capital requirement from the Basel Committee). 

Strong technical and functional challenges to adapt the legacy risk computation engine (1300+ nodes) in order to be scalable (20x more computations than the traditional VaR).

Achievements:

* Member of the chapter *Software Craftmanship*
* Member of the transversal guild of Tech Leaders
* Staff recruitment
* Progressively adapted the existing engine to new paradigms (VaR scenarios now depends on the product characteristics), and helped implement the Internal Models based approach, the Expected Shortfall
* Started implementing a simpler functional architecture (1 given input => 1 predictable output)
* Demystified, decoupled, optimized the legacy grid-based risk calculator (1000+ nodes)
* Introduced more recent technologies that still respects the existing architecture:
   * Big Data & NoSQL -- Apache Cassandra
   * Monitoring -- Grafana, InfluxDb, AppMetrics and health checks
   * Microservices architecture -- consul.io, traefik

> **Technologies:** SAFe methodology, C#, VB.NET, Sybase, MsSQL, Cassandra, MongoDb, IBM Symphony (grid computing), git & teamcity, consul.io & traefik, InfluxDb
