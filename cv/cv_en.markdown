FRTB (aka Basel III) is a set of laws that will define the new market risk capital rules, starting from Jan 2020.
These new rules would require 10x more computations.

Strong technical and functional challenges to adapt the legacy risk computation engine in order to be scalable.

* Member of the transversal guild of Tech Leaders
* Staff recruitement
* Progressively changed the existing engine to be adapted to new paradigms (dynamic VaR scenarios depending on the financial product)
* Started implementing a simpler functional architecture (1 given input => 1 predictable output)
* Decoupled components and services
* Chose and introduced more recent technologies that still respects the existing architecture:
   * NoSQL -- Cassandra
   * Monitoring -- stack Grafana+InfluDb+AppMetrics
   * Microservices -- consul.io, traefik
